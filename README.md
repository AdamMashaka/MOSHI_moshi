This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This website has been built using [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), and it uses an SQL Database to pull products data from the DB.

For the project to run correctly on your local, you need to create environment variables where these are required.
Please feel free to use any parts of the code if you wish.
