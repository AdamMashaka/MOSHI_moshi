This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The live website can be foound at [www.moshimoshiproject.co.uk/](https://www.moshimoshiproject.co.uk/)

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies with

```bash
npm install
```

This website has been built using [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), and it uses an SQL Database to pull products data from the DB.

For the project to run correctly on your local, you need to create environment variables where these are required to pull data from the DB.
Then you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Alternatively you can run

```bash
npm run storybook
```

to view client components on Storybook on [http://localhost:6006/](http://localhost:6006)
